# YEC Debunks

This project was created to debunk some of the misconceptions and lies told by young earth creationism. 

## Running locally

To get started:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ch1ru/yecdebunks.git
cd yecdebunks && npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

You can also run with docker:
```bash
cd yecdebunks
docker build -t yecdebunks -p 3000:3000 .
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser

Any help is greatly appreciated!
